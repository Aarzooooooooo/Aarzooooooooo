## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Aarzoo Gupta, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) from KCC Institute of Technology and Management. I have a strong passion for technology, especially in the field of AI, and Iâ€™m always eager to explore how machine learning can solve real-world problems. My journey in computer science has equipped me with skills in algorithms, and coding, which Iâ€™m constantly improving. I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends, and Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to apply what Iâ€™ve learned in innovative ways.
